Strategy design pattern is a beheavioral design pattern, which enables you to identify a set of algorithms, Encapsulate them in
separate classes and make them interchangeabe at runtime by using composition instead of inheritance. meaning we create an
Interface(in Java) or an Abstract class that defines the methods that will be used by the classes that will implement this
interface or extend this abstract class. This way we can have multiple classes that implement the same interface or extend the
same abstract class, and each class can have its own implementation of the methods defined in the interface or abstract class.
This way we can have multiple implementations of the same method, and we can choose which implementation to use at runtime.
